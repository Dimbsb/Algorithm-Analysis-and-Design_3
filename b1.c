/* 1. Re-implement Prim's algorithm from Lab 5 but this time using as a data structure 
of adjacency lists rather than adjacency tables (an example with adjacency lists is in Lab 4). 
Call the function for 4 different graphs and schematically show the minimum pairwise tree 
(i.e. put a picture showing each graph and a picture showing the result of Prim's algorithm in your report). 
Provide your code file and explain your implementation in the pdf file. Why is your implementation 
better than that of lab 5? Also, show a screenshot of the implementation in the pdf file.*/
