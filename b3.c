/* 3. Look for information about the “Reverse-delete algorithm” which is also used for
finding a minimum mating tree. Implement the algorithm and compare computationally with 
the previous two algorithms by creating a computational study. Provide your code file and
explain your implementation in the pdf file. Finally, show screenshot of the execution in the pdf file.*/
